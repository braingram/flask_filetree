An example of a flask blueprint that uses jquery filetree to
browse local files.

import flask_filetree
flask_filetree.run()

open web browser and go to 127.0.0.1:5000/test to view your home directory

To use this in a real flask app use:

import flask
import flask_filetree

app = flask.Flask(__name__)
# maybe setup your app here
ft = flask_filetree.make_blueprint(app=app)
# or here
app.register_blueprint(ft, url_prefix='/filetree')
# or here

app.run()
